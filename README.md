## Description:
Full Stack Web App with MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) that lets users create surveys and send them to a list of email addresses. 
Uses OAuth for authentication, Stripe API to create mock payments, and SendGrid API to send emails.  Using purchased credits, a user may create and send out surveys and track recipient feedback. 

## Instructions:
* Login with Google
* App requires users to maintain a credit balance.  To purchase mock credits, use credit card **4242-4242-4242-4242** with any future expiration data along with any random CVC and email.
* Click the red + icon at the bottom right to create a new survey.
* Fill out the survey form to email the survey to your desired email addresses.
* Recipients may respond to the survey with a Yes/No option in the email.
* Feedback is tracked on the user dashboard.  Users can view customer feedback and details of all surveys they've created. 
  * For example, if a user sends a survey to 100 recipients and 60 recipients respond, the user can see the breakdown of these 60 responses.
